                <h3>Snake AI Assignment</h3>
                <p>This project implements an autonomous Snake game agent that navigates a grid-based environment to
                    collect
                    food while avoiding collisions with walls, other snakes and its own body. The AI models the game
                    board as
                    a graph and uses the A* algorithm to compute the shortest safe path to the food at each step.
